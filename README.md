## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

PackageGames is a collection of three Unity-developed mobile games that showcase different gameplay mechanics while maintaining a consistent package delivery theme. The project demonstrates versatility in game development, featuring an incremental clicker game, an arcade-style endless runner, and a challenging platformer.

**PackageClicker** is an idle/incremental game where players click on packages to earn points, purchase upgrades, and automate their package collection process. The game includes various upgrade systems, visual effects, and progression mechanics typical of the clicker genre.

**FlappyPackage** takes inspiration from the classic Flappy Bird gameplay, reimagined with package-themed graphics and mechanics. Players navigate a package through obstacles while maintaining momentum and achieving high scores.

**PackageClimber** offers an endless climbing experience where players guide a package character up increasingly challenging vertical levels, avoiding obstacles and collecting power-ups along the way.

All three games are built using Unity 2022.3.16f1 and are optimized for mobile deployment with touch-friendly controls and responsive UI design.
